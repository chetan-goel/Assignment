# Assignment

I completed this assignment with mind set of simplicity as mentioned in description. 
Please find my thoughts and actions below on this assigment.

1. I could not include design patterns because to make it simple and easy to understand and most important the problem in itself was not demanding to use design patterns.
2. I program this application as to use it in single Threade environment. For the purpose of completion.
3. Other wise this kind of application could be possible to make in multi-threaded environment and having ultra responsive and low-latency. As this have to be a real-time tool, so it has to be well engineered.
4. Customized Exceptions and non-blocking object pools could be part of it to make it to production level and to support multiple clients at a time.
5. As I understood the problem, I include all locations comma seperated in csv file 'Content.csv' that arrived after querying city_name. As single city return the array of locations. So I include all those. May be I misunderstood.

Please consider my solution in terms of correctness and programming structure. 

Thanks
