# Assignment

I completed this assignment with mind set of simplicity as mentioned in description. 
Please find my thoughts and actions below on this assigment.

1. I could not include Oops principles and design patterns because to make it simple and easty to understand and most important the problem in itself was not demanding to use design patterns.
2. I program this application as to use it in single Threade environment. For the purpose of completion.
3. Other wise this kind of application could be possible to make in multi-threaded environment and having ultra responsive and low-latency. As this is have to be a real-time tool, so it has to be well engineered.
4. Custom Exceptions and non-blocking object pools could be part of it to make it to production level and to support multiple clients at a time.

Please consider my solution in terms of correctness and programming structure. 

Thanks
